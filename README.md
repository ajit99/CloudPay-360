CloudPay 360
One Platform. Every Payment. Fully Cloud-Native.
CloudPay 360 is a unified payment platform designed to simplify payment processing for businesses, enabling seamless, secure, and scalable transactions globally.
Problem Statement
Fragmented payment systems create integration complexity, scalability challenges, and poor visibility, costing businesses time and revenue. Merchants often lose revenue due to payment failures or high integration costs.
Solution
CloudPay 360 simplifies payments with a single, secure API, enabling businesses to scale globally with ease. It reduces integration time by up to 50% and includes AI-driven fraud detection for enhanced security.
Features

Unified Payment API: Single endpoint for all payment types and currencies.
Real-Time Fraud Detection: Powered by serverless AWS Lambda for predictive analytics.
Scalability: Built with cloud-native technologies for global transaction handling.
Visibility: Real-time dashboard updates via Kafka messaging.

Tech Stack

Backend: Java, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, Redis
Frontend: React (assumed, not implemented here)
Cloud: AWS (API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB), Terraform, Docker
Messaging: Kafka

Architecture
CloudPay 360 follows a modular, cloud-native architecture:

User: Initiates a payment request (e.g., merchant).
API Gateway: Routes requests to services (Spring Boot REST API).
Authentication Service: Validates user identity (e.g., JWT).
Payment Orchestrator: Coordinates payment processing, fraud checks, and storage.
Fraud Detection: Real-time analysis using serverless logic (simulated AWS Lambda).
Database: Stores payment data (PostgreSQL).
Kafka: Publishes payment events for asynchronous processing.
Dashboard: Updates UI with payment status (React-based, not implemented).

Note: Replace the placeholder image with a diagram created in tools like Lucidchart or Draw.io.
